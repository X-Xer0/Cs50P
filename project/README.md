## File Structure:

### `project.py`
This is the main Python file containing all core functionality. The file includes:
- `main()`: The entry point of the program. It serves as the central hub that connects all features.
- `search_anime()`: Fetches anime details using the Jikan API and displays search results.
- `manage_watchlist()`: Handles user watchlists, allowing addition, removal, and viewing of anime titles.
- `get_recommendations()`: Fetches anime recommendations based on the user's input genre.
- `play_trivia()`: Implements a simple trivia game for anime enthusiasts.

### `test_project.py`
This file contains tests for the custom functions in `project.py`. It uses the `pytest` framework to ensure all functions behave as expected:
- `test_search_anime()`: Verifies that the `search_anime` function exists and is callable.
- `test_manage_watchlist()`: Verifies the existence and functionality of `manage_watchlist`.
- `test_get_recommendations()`: Ensures `get_recommendations` is callable.
- `test_play_trivia()`: Confirms the functionality of the `play_trivia` function.

### `requirements.txt`
This file lists the dependencies required for the project:
- `requests`: A Python library used to interact with the Jikan API for fetching anime data.

## Design Choices:
1. **Use of Jikan API**:
   - The Jikan API provides a vast database of anime details, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
   - This choice eliminates the need to maintain a local database, reducing complexity.

2. **Watchlist Storage**:
   - A JSON file is used for persistence. This simple format is human-readable, lightweight, and easy to integrate with Pythonâ€™s `json` module.

3. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - A CLI was chosen for its simplicity and minimal dependencies, ensuring the project runs on any machine with Python installed.
   - The menu-driven system enhances usability and makes navigation straightforward.

4. **Trivia Game**:
   - Added as a lighthearted feature to increase user engagement and provide a break from the primary functionalities.

## Challenges and Future Improvements:
### Challenges:
- Handling API rate limits: The Jikan API has a limit on requests per minute. A caching mechanism or request throttling could be implemented to handle this in future iterations.
- Data parsing: Parsing nested JSON data from the API and ensuring correct formatting required careful handling.

### Future Improvements:
1. **Expand Trivia**:
   - Incorporate more trivia questions and allow users to contribute their own.
   - Fetch questions dynamically from an external source.

2. **Enhanced Recommendations**:
   - Add filters like popularity, year of release, or studios for more tailored recommendations.
   - Enable recommendations based on the user's watchlist history.

3. **Graphical Interface**:
   - Transition from CLI to a GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for better user experience.
