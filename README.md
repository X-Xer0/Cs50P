## 📂 Repository Structure

---

### 1. Problem Sets and Assignments
Each folder corresponds to a problem set from the course, containing:
- **Code files**: My Python implementations of the assignments.
- **README.md (if applicable)**: Descriptions of the problem and my approach to solving it.

The assignments progressively build skills in:
- Python fundamentals
- Writing clean, modular code
- Utilizing libraries like `csv`, `json`, and `fpdf`
- Error handling and debugging
- Writing unit tests using `pytest`

### 2. Final Project: MyAnimeWorld
#### 📝 Description:
For my final project, I developed **MyAnimeWorld**, a Python-based mini version of anime listing platforms like MyAnimeList or AniList. MyAnimeWorld allows users to:
- Search for anime by name.
- View details about an anime, including its title, synopsis, genre, and rating.
- Add anime to a personal watchlist.
- Update their watchlist with statuses (e.g., watching, completed, on hold).
- Export their watchlist to a file for sharing or backup.

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **JSON**: For data storage and retrieval.
- **Pytest**: For testing core functions to ensure accuracy and reliability.

#### 📚 Learning Outcomes:
Through MyAnimeWorld, I applied concepts learned during the course, including:
- Function design and modular programming
- File I/O for storing and retrieving data
- User input validation and error handling
- Writing test cases for robust applications

## 🌟 Highlights
- **Assignments**: Each problem set is designed to deepen understanding of Python concepts.
- **Final Project**: A culmination of everything I learned, applied to a project I'm passionate about—anime!
